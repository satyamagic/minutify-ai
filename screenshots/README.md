# Screenshots

This directory contains application screenshots for the README.

## Required Screenshots

1. **dashboard.png** - Main dashboard view showing stats and quick actions
2. **detail-view.png** - Meeting detail page with raw content
3. **transcript.png** - Audio transcript with timestamps
4. **ai-analysis.png** - AI analysis panel with summary and action items

## How to Generate Screenshots

1. Run the application: `npm run dev`
2. Log in and create sample data
3. Take screenshots at 1920x1080 resolution
4. Save with the filenames listed above
5. Optimize images (use tools like TinyPNG)

## Placeholder

Until screenshots are generated, the README will show broken image links, which is acceptable for development.

For production/portfolio presentation, ensure all screenshots are high-quality and properly demonstrate the application's features.
